/**
 * Binds the Subject's state to the accessible {@link Session Session} in addition to the
 * {@link org.apache.ki.util.ThreadContext ThreadContext}
 * <p/>
 * The very notion of this class's existence might sound backwards:  typically a {@link Session Session} is something
 * that is created <em>after</em> a {@link Subject Subject} is acquired - for example by calling
 * <code>Subject.{@link Subject#getSession getSession()}</code>.  This might imply that a <code>Session</code> is also
 * therefore constrained to the 'owning' <code>Subject</code>'s lifecycle.
 * <p/>
 * However, in many environments, the <code>Subject</code> instance in memory is transient and exists only for the
 * duration of thread execution or during an incoming request in web environments.  The <code>Session</code> however
 * must be persistent over time since that is the very nature of the concept of a <code>Session</code>.  So, this
 * particular <code>SubjectBinder</code> implementation will save the relevant <code>Subject</code> state as
 * <code>Session</code> attributes to enable the <code>Subject</code> to be constructed on subsequent requests or
 * method invocations.
 * <p/>
 * This paradigm requires some framework code elsewhere to re-create the <code>Subject</code>:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A session ID would be acquired based on an incoming request or remote method invocation</li>
 * <li>The <code>Session</code> would be retrieved from the application's {@link SecurityManager SecurityManager}
 * (using the {@link org.apache.ki.session.mgt.SessionManager SessionManager} parent methods)</li>
 * <li>A <code>Subject</code> instance would be created based on the attributes found in that session</code>
 * <li>The constructed <code>Subject</code> would be 'bound' to the application for use during the request or method
 * invocation (say, bound to the processing thread)</li>
 * <li>The subject would then be accessible to the application for the duration of the thread</li>
 * <li>Any state changed to the subject at the end of the thread execution would be saved to back to the
 * <code>Session</code></li>
 * <li>The <code>Subject</code> instance wold be 'unbound' from the application/thread and garbage collected at the
 * end of request/thread execution, and a new one is created on the next request/method invocation as per step #1.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * Indeed this is exactly how Ki's default behavior works in enterprise server and web-based environments.  It is
 * enabled in the <code>KiFilter</code> for web-based environments as well as remote-method-invocation-based
 * components for non-web environments.
